# Chess Game

This is a simple implementation of a chess game in Java. The project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for playing chess and includes most chess rules except for castling.

## Features

- Play chess against another player locally.
- Supports pawn promotion and allows the player to choose the promoted piece.
- Highlights available move options for selected pieces.
- Checks for check and checkmate conditions.

## Getting Started

To run the chess game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
3. Compile the Java files:
4. Run the main program:


## How to Play

1. Run the program and the chess board will be displayed.
2. The GUI will guide you to make moves by selecting a piece and then selecting a valid destination.
3. For pawn promotion, when a pawn reaches the last row, you can choose the promotion piece from the options presented.
4. The game checks for check and checkmate conditions, and the GUI will display the outcome accordingly.
